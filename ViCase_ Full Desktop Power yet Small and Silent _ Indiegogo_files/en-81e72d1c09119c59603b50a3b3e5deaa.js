Rewind to 2008: Danae Ringelmann was an MBA student trying to open an Off-Broadway play. Eric Schell searched for funds for a Chicago theater company in his spare time. Slava Rubin started a charity event for myeloma cancer research after losing his father to the disease. Their struggles to find funding revealed a fundamental flaw in the system: For centuries, access to funds has been controlled by a select few. Danae, Eric, and Slava started Indiegogo in order to revolutionize the flow of funding, so it can reach and grow the ideas that matter.","Now, the future is determined by you.
